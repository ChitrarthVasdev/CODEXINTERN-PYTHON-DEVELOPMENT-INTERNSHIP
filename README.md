- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for visualizations.

### **Tasks Performed:**
- Calculated averages and correlations.
- Visualized trends using:
  - Bar charts
  - Scatter plots
  - Heatmaps
  - Distribution plots

## 2. 🏠 House Price Prediction

### **Objective:**
Develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on property features.

### **Dataset Used:**
- `Housing.csv` — includes features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, air conditioning, furnishing status, etc.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **Pandas** and **LabelEncoder** for preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn** for model building.
- **Linear Regression** for prediction.

### **Tasks Performed:**
- Categorical encoding using `LabelEncoder`.
- Train-test split.
- Linear regression model training.
- Model evaluation with:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
- Sample prediction outputs.
